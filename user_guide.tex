\begin{abstract}
        We present the main capabilities of EDACC and describe how to use EDACC for managing solvers and instances, create experiments with them, launch them on different computer clusters, monitor them and then analyze the results.

\section{Outline}
Here we will have an overview of this user guide specifying where the user can find what!

\section{Introduction}
Specification of the problems algorithm engineers are often confronted with! \\
\index{Algorithm engineering}\marginlabel{Algorithm engineering:}
When designing and implementing algorithms one is at the end of the process confronted with the problem of evaluatating the implementation on the targeted problem set. As the authors of \edacc are familiar with algorithms for the satisfiability problem we will take this sort of algorithms as examples. After designing and implementing a SAT solver we would like to see how this performs on a set of instance problems (let us suppose that our solver is an implementation of a stochastic one \ie the result of the solver on the same instance will be a random variable).

Normally we would start our solver on each instance and record the runtime or some quality measure. This is a sequential process and could be easily performed with the help of a simple shell script. But there are some questions that have to be answered before starting this evaluation process. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item How long is the solver allowed to compute on one instance?
\item In the case of randomized solvers, how often do we call the solver on each problem set?
\item Do we limit the resources used by the solver (\ie maximum of memory, maximum stack size)?
\end{enumerate}
