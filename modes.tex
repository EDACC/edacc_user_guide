\subsection{Modes}
\edacc is split up in two modes:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Manage DB Mode
	\item Experiment Mode
\end{enumerate}
There is a strict split-up between these two modes. You can be only in one mode when working with \edacc.
When starting \edacc you will always be in the the manage DB mode, which will allow you to manage your solvers and instances before creating experiments with them. 
To switch between modes you have to choose the desired mode from the menu bar \textbf{Mode}.
